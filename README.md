# python-intro-project
This is F226093's intro to python project, a library management system. 
The library management system is very comprehensive, even including an overdue. 
If say, Bob checks out a book, he has two weeks to return the book, otherwise it is overdue. 
It is worth noting however, that there was previously randomly generated date, with random dates, so the date can be really old. 
The librarian can also check what books a user has, in addition to the normal check in, check-out, and reserve. 
The librarian can put a four number ID, say, 4417, and the system will output all the books by 4417. 
Moreover, the search book is comprehensive in the sense that the librarian can choose the type they want to search, 
the search will then be ordered from greatest amount checked out, to least amount checked out.
On the other hand, the project reuses many components multiple times as those methods were planned about. 
This is a comprehensive library management system by F226093.
